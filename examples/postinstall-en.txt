To complete installation, you must

1. Update MySQL's grant tables and the pmadb database:
     mysql -u root -p < ${MY_SQLSCRIPTSDIR}/mysql/${PVR}_create.sql
2. Reload MySQL:
     /etc/init.d/mysql restart

If you are upgrading from an earlier version and are using phpMyAdmin's
features for master/foreign tables be sure to read
  http://localhost/phpmyadmin/Documentation.html#col_com
You will need to perform the ALTER TABLE step yourself.

Finally, point your browser to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/.
